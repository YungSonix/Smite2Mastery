Being so cheap but being combined with an Item Protection threshold to be effective made it feel awkward to build. We are increasing the cost to be able to provide more stats, making it feel better in a completed build. Additionally, we are removing the Item Protection Threshold and instead focusing the gameplay towards gods that can consistently disrupt and Crowd Control their opponents, by making each stack more impactful, straightforward, and rewarding players who can apply multiple control effects over the length of a fight."
